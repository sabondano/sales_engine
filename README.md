# SalesEngine
In this project I practiced building a system of several interacting Ruby objects using TDD.

## Project Overview

## Goals

Use tests to drive both the design and implementation of code
Use test fixtures instead of actual data when testing
Build a complex system of relationships using multiple interacting classes
Demonstrate the DRY principle with modules and/or duck typing
Separate parsing and data loading logic from business logic
Use memoization to improve performance

## Abstract

A data reporting tool that manipulates and reports on merchant transactional data.
